Besides Research on this Project, Steps I took:

1. Connected Arduino UNO to Laptop. This allowed power to flow from my laptop to the 
Arduino board
2. Plugged button onto BreadBoard
3. Used Red Jumper wire to connect 5v pin from Arduino to positive terminal of BreadBoard
4. Used Black Jumper wire to connect Ground pin from Arduino to negative terminal of BreadBoard
5. Used another Red Jumper wire to connect from positive terminal to one leg of the button
6. Used 10k Ohm resistor to connect from negative terminal to another leg of the button
7. Used Blue Jumper wire to connect from digital input pin 2 to the leg with the resistor
8. Tested button circuit by utilizing default Button Program
9. Button passed functional test, so I created the actual program for the project
10. Wrote the program, compiled, and tested

How much of the Project is working:
Project is Finished. The Program can cycle from 1hz -> 2hz -> 4hz -> 8hz -> 1hz
